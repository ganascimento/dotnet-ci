## What is CI?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, allowing for early detection and resolution of integration issues. Developers commit their code changes to a version control system, triggering an automated process that compiles the code and runs tests. If any part of the process fails, it's considered a "broken" integration, and developers are alerted. CI promotes frequent code integration, reducing the risk of conflicts and bugs and ensuring that the codebase remains in a working state. This practice enhances collaboration, code quality, and development speed by catching and addressing problems early in the development process, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient software delivery.
