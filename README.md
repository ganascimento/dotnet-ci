# Dotnet CI

This project was developed to test the CI implementation, with test analysis and SonarCloud

## Resources used

To develop this project, was used:

- DotNet 7
- Moq

## What is CI?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, allowing for early detection and resolution of integration issues. Developers commit their code changes to a version control system, triggering an automated process that compiles the code and runs tests. If any part of the process fails, it's considered a "broken" integration, and developers are alerted. CI promotes frequent code integration, reducing the risk of conflicts and bugs and ensuring that the codebase remains in a working state. This practice enhances collaboration, code quality, and development speed by catching and addressing problems early in the development process, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient software delivery.

## And SonarCloud?

SonarCloud is a cloud-based platform for continuous code quality inspection and software development. It integrates with popular programming languages and version control systems, analyzing code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues. Developers and teams use SonarCloud to automate code reviews and maintain high software quality standards throughout the development process. It provides actionable insights and recommendations, enabling faster error detection and code improvement, ultimately enhancing the reliability and security of software projects. SonarCloud plays a crucial role in improving code quality and reducing technical debt, leading to more efficient and robust software development practices.
